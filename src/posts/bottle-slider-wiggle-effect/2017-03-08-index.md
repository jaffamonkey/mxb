<p class="lead">Bringing quality to all aspects of a project, Quality assurance and testing across the SDLC.</p>

{% callout "info" %}
Every test should be able to provide the same answer of "Yes", at any point, to the question "Are you useful?".
{% endcallout %}

## Our focus
- Adaptive test strategies.
- Applying quality checks from design through to development.
- Lean UI and API test frameworks.
- Performance tests with every build to check Accessibility, Load and Security.
- Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines as early as possible.
- Native tools always preferred.
- Test frameworks part of app codebase.
