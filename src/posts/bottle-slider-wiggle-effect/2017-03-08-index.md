<p class="lead">Bringing quality to all aspects of a project, Quality assurance and testing across the SDLC.</p>

{% callout "info" %}
Testing strategies to help you implement new tools and approaches across teams.
Test engineering architecture and implementation within your CI/CD pipelines.
Process improvements to enable more efficient testing from Sprint to Sprint.
{% endcallout %}

## Our focus
- Adaptive test strategies.
- Applying quality checks from design through to development. 
- UI/API test frameworks to eliminate issues related to manual testing.
- Performance tests with every build to check Accessibility, Load and Security.
- Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines as early as possible.

## Test development in line with development cycle.
- Every test should be able to provide the same answer of "Yes", at any point, to the question "Are you useful?".
- Starting lean with test framework is logical, wait for test development to highlight possible requirement.
- Native tools always preferred, firstly for synergy with development and secondly performance and scope larger.
- Test frameworks should be part of app codebase.
