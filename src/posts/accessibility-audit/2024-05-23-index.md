# Accessibility Standards

W3C specified the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) success criteria for Accessibility compliance. Following these guidelinesz will provide greater accessibility to a wider range of people with disabilities, across a range of devices (desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones).

For mobile apps, [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility) and [Android's Accessibility Principles](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility), should also be taken into consideration.

## Summary

The audit targets a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Professionally evaluating the website's accessibility level is a key step in web accessibility and can be performed at any stage of a web or mobile app project.
