<p class="lead">Container Queries are one of the most anticipated new features in CSS. I recently got a chance to play with them a bit and take the new syntax for a spin.</p>

I came up with this demo of a book store. Each of the books is draggable and can be moved to one of three sections, with varying available space. Depending on where it is placed, different styles will be applied to the book. The [full source code](https://codepen.io/mxbck/pen/XWMrMOp) is up on Codepen. Here's how it looks:

<div class="extend">
    <video width="960" style="margin:0 auto; border: 1px solid var(--color-border);" preload controls>
        <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mxb/video/upload/q_auto/v1621003114/bookstore_nnn2vr.webm" type="video/webm" />
        <source src="https://res.cloudinary.com/mxb/video/upload/q_auto/v1621003115/bookstore_kkpxmt.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

{% callout "warning" %}
This demo currently only works in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/). Download the latest version, then enable Container Queries under *chrome://flags* to see them in action.

## Testing in the pipeline
With a simple set of choices, we can run accessibility tests in our pipelines and generate useful feedback for your development and design teams.

While manual checks are always recommended, you can achieve a high degree of prevention by introducing automation into your design and development cycles.

## The tools
- NVDA and Voiceover Screenreader output
- Sitemap/URLs scanners
- Performance checkers
- Mobile app accessibility tests on real cloud devices

For real device tests, we use customised popular frameworks, such as Espresso, XCUITest and Playwright, which enables testing in a more real-life context. 

## Code analysis
_(requires read-only access to your codebase)_
- CodeQL code analysis
- Semgrep code analysis
- SonarQube code analysis
