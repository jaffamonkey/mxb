{% callout "tip" %}
Understanding why accessibility makes you a better and smarter organisation is the first step in any long-term strategy.
{% endcallout %}

Define accessibility goals and requirements at the outset, with an Accessibility strategy. This includes understanding legal obligations and setting clear objectives for compliance with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.2)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). This will set out the clear aims of how Accessibility will be included in each phase of app development.

## Why do a strategy?

### Drive Innovation
Accessibility features in products and services often solve unanticipated problems.

### Enhance Your Brand 
Diversity and inclusion efforts so important to business success are accelerated with a clear, well-integrated accessibility commitment.

### Extend Market Reach
The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the online experience for all users.

### Minimize Legal Risk
Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility, and the issue is of increased legal concern.
