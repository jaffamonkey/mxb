## Why do a strategy?

### Drive Innovation
Accessibility features in products and services often solve unanticipated problems.

### Enhance Your Brand 
Diversity and inclusion efforts so important to business success are accelerated with a clear, well-integrated accessibility commitment.

### Extend Market Reach
The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the online experience for all users.

### Minimize Legal Risk
Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility, and the issue is of increased legal concern.
