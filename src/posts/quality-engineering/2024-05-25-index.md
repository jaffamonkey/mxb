{% callout "tip" %}
If you are trying to "shift left, I can help bring testing earlier and more frequently, into the design and development cycles.
{% endcallout %}

Firstly I develop adaptive test strategies for applying quality checks from design through to development. At the core of the implementation are lean UI and API test frameworks, integrated into CI/CD pipelines. Along with performance tests with every build to check accessibility, load and security.

## Our focus
* Adaptive test strategies.
* Applying quality checks from design through to development. 
* UI test frameworks to do richer tests, focused on UX.
* API test frameworks with service virtulisation to ensure test continuity.
* Performance tests with every build to check Accessibility, Load and Security.
* Integrating testing into CI/CD pipelines as early as possible.
